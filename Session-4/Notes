VNET Peering:
We want to estalblish a communication in the following cases:
1) Make Communication possible between vNET's in SAME REGION
2) Make Communication possible between vNET's in DIFFERENT REGION
3) Make Communication possible between vNET's in DIFFERENT SUBSCRIPTION

We're proving 2 statements over here:
1. The DEV-SUBSCRIPTION is in one Tenant but we are using different subscription.
i.e vNET & VM is also in that subscription only.
2. If we have 2 subscriptions we can able to estalblish the communication between them by 
using vNET Peering.

3. Incase if you have the 2 Tenant's ID's in between them also possible to 
estalblish a communication between them. But here the setup and practical is taken complicated.

Finally, vNET Peering is possible in this ways:
- In one location using vNET Peering is possible.
- In multiple regions also vNET Peering is possible.
- In Multiple subscriptions also vNET peering is possible.
- In Multiple Tenant's also vNET peering is possible.
